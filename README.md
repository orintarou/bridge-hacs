# BridgehaCS
[BridghaCS website](https://bridgehacs.herokuapp.com/ "Title").. Previously built on Openshift using Angular.

Trying to help form a strong developer atmosphere in Boston, because even though there's a large development group, it's not really connected that well.  Doing my part as a programmer and trying to connect students from around the area with each other!

Originally was on bridgehacs.org, but I decided not to keep paying for hosting since the hackathon ended.
